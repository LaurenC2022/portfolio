# Weekly Status 

## Independent Study goals

My goals are centered around developing a strong foundation in web development, programming, and DevOps. I aim to build a professional online presence by creating a personal portfolio project and establishing a consistent blogging routine to showcase my skills and knowledge. Additionally, I plan to develop a comprehensive ecommerce project using NopCommerce, learn about RESTful APIs and microservices architecture, and build a Command-Line Interface (CLI) application using Java. I also intend to explore web scraping using Python and automate tasks using Azure DevOps, Key Vault, and Logic Apps. By achieving these goals, I aim to enhance my technical skills, improve my online presence, and increase my employability in the tech industry.
