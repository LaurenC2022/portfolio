## About Me 

I am passionate about leveraging technology and collaboration to drive impactful projects. Currently, I am preparing for the Certified Associate in Project Management (CAPM) exam through the Project Management Institute.

My background as a middle school math teacher sharpened my ability to communicate complex concepts clearly and collaborate effectively with diverse teams. These skills translate into my role as a technical leader, where I facilitate coding workshops and mentor others within my community. My long-term goal is to contribute to global technical forums and conferences, sharing insights on project management, software architecture, and emerging technologies.

Looking ahead, I aim to deepen my expertise in teaching and expand my impact. Over the next five years, my goals include:

- Earning certification to teach advanced math.

- Become certified to teach computer science and inspire girls and young women to explore the field—more on this later.

- Staying active in coding communities like Virtual Coffee and Codebar, while building projects for fun and growth.

I'm working toward becoming certified to teach computer science, with a special focus on encouraging girls and women to explore the field. I envision leading a hands-on, lab-style classroom where students can dive into foundational topics like command-line tools, basic programming, the Fibonacci sequence, data visualization, recursion, and Bash scripting. To give students a realistic view of the developer experience, we'll use GitHub and incorporate Agile principles throughout the course. I also plan to introduce an algorithm-and-data-structure pair to build their problem-solving skills and computational thinking. To round out the experience, students will complete a project that combines Figma, WordPress, and web hosting—giving them a taste of both design and deployment. My goal is to provide a well-rounded, engaging introduction to computer science that builds confidence and curiosity in every learner. Lastly, we would work with AI as it is the future of tech. 

I am committed to continuous learning and to developing adaptable workflows that keep pace with the rapidly evolving tech landscape. I enjoy teaching math and computer science and look forward to a long, fulfilling career in education—while also pursuing passion projects that challenge and inspire me.

I excel in problem-solving, team coordination, and driving projects to successful completion. By combining technical expertise, project management skills, and a strong teaching background, I create innovative learning experiences that foster personal growth and leave a lasting impact. I teach grades 4–12 professionally and lead adult workshops as a passion project.
