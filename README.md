## About Me 

I am passionate about computer programming. This is why I am currently pursuing a bachelor's of science degree in applied computer science from a college of engineering and applied science. I have built several, personal, frontend web application projects. I have also built a python project for modeling the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman Algorithm. You can see this project in my portfolio above. I am currently building a Full-Stack application using python, and html/css with a team of developers. The project will be accessible in my portfolio soon. I am updating my skills to include C sharp, dot net, and Azure hosting in the Fall semester of 2024.

In my work as a middle school math teacher, I have experience communicating and working efficiently in a team of professionals. I would like to use my teaching background to speak at conferences or universities around the globe.

I am focusing my work on C sharp, Azure hosting and Dot Net for application development. I would like for a large part of my work to involve Microsoft's frameworks. Over the next five years, I would like to become an independent contributor. By the middle of my career and in 10 to 15 years, I will know the nitty gritty of software development methodologies and data driven development as a project manager. Lastly, my long term goals include being highly trained in orchestrating functional, secure, and accessible computer applications with architecture for scalability. At the end of my career, I will be a distinguished software architect. Right now, I am interested in knowing as much as I can about computer application engineering. I am actively working toward accomplishing my professional goals in my daily life.

Currently, I am considering open source projects to contribute to. I am challenging myself through leading workshops on topics which I am learning. I am learning, through teaching. I am planning to teach workshops on the topic of software development methodologies for Virtual Coffee, my local Code Bar community and for https://cfe.dev in September of this year. Next I would like to teach workshops on the topic of algorithms and data structures in c sharp using test driven development, and agile development in early 2025. I am preparing myself for my future goals every day.

My goal while at university is to gain a good foundation in computer science, which will lead to a long career and life long learning in the field of computer application development. I can be a valuable team member in a variety of projects. I am skilled in problem solving and utilizing online communities to find the most suitable coding solutions. I am open to work and would ideally like to join a team of seasoned engineers. I can contribute my programming, excellent communication and problem solving skills. I seek to build long lasting professional relationships.
