## About Me 

I am passionate about computer programming and have built several personal frontend web applications. One of my key projects involved modeling the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman Algorithm using Python, which you can find in my portfolio. Currently, I am building a full-stack application using C#, .NET, and nopCommerce, focusing on technologies widely used in American industries. I am also expanding my skill set by exploring Java to diversify my expertise. My daily routine includes studying algorithms, developing projects, and incorporating automation to optimize my workflow.

My previous experience as a middle school math teacher has honed my communication skills and ability to collaborate with teams of professionals. I leverage this experience to lead coding workshops in the communities I’m involved in, with the goal of one day speaking at conferences and universities around the world. I am passionate about continuous learning and actively pursue opportunities to teach and share knowledge.

Looking ahead, my focus is on becoming highly skilled in DevOps, software engineering, and software architecture. I aim to specialize in Microsoft frameworks while diversifying into Java development. Over the next five years, I plan to establish a workflow that keeps me up to date with the latest technologies and research, particularly through open-source contributions and learning from top universities. I am also staying current with advancements in AI by learning Python.

I excel in problem-solving and utilize online communities to find the most effective coding solutions. I am seeking opportunities to work alongside seasoned engineers, where I can contribute my programming skills, strong communication abilities, and passion for long-lasting professional relationships.

## Productivity Tools: 

I am a busy mom. I use these tools to keep my family, my home and my career running: 

    - Time Management Excel Book (Personal)
    - Project Mangaement Excel Book (Work)
    - [Recipe Sage](https://recipesage.com/#/people/@full_stack_lauren): These are the recipes i use for dinner. Recipe Sage is open source software and a friendly community to contribute to. I added my family recipes and use the meal planning and grocery list tools to plan healthy meals my family will eat 
    - Budgeting Excel Spreadsheet 
    - Expenses Tracking Tool 

## Weekly Status Updates

My goals are centered around developing a strong foundation in web development, programming, and DevOps. I aim to build a professional online presence by creating this Weekly Status Update and establishing a consistent blogging routine to showcase my skills and knowledge.
