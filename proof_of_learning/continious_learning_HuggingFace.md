# Question: how much time per week do I need to have free to do all of this?

To make significant progress with FreeCodeCamp and other learning resources, I recommend dedicating a consistent amount of time each week. Here's a rough estimate of the time commitment required:

**FreeCodeCamp:**

* 4-6 hours per week: This will allow you to complete 1-2 challenges per day, 3-4 days a week. You can adjust the pace to fit your schedule, but this will give you a good starting point.

**Additional learning resources:**

* 1-2 hours per week: Set aside time to explore other resources, such as online courses, tutorials, or YouTube channels. This will help you supplement your learning and gain a deeper understanding of specific topics.

**Personal projects and experimentation:**

* 2-4 hours per week: As you progress, you'll want to work on personal projects or experiment with new technologies. This time will help you apply what you've learned and build a portfolio of projects.

**Total time commitment:**

* 7-12 hours per week: This is a rough estimate, but it should give you a good balance between structured learning, exploration, and practical application.

**Tips for managing your time:**

1. **Schedule it**: Treat your learning time as non-negotiable and schedule it in your calendar.
2. **Break it down**: Divide your learning time into smaller chunks, such as 30 minutes to 1 hour per day, to make it more manageable.
3. **Prioritize**: Focus on the most important tasks and challenges first, and then move on to less pressing ones.
4. **Be flexible**: Don't be too hard on yourself if you miss a day or two. Adjust your schedule as needed and keep moving forward.

Remember, consistency is key. Even 30 minutes of focused learning per day can be more effective than trying to cram all your learning into one or two long sessions per week.
