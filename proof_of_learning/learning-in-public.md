# Weekly Status 

## Independent Study goals

My goals are centered around developing a strong foundation in web development, programming, and DevOps. I aim to build a professional online presence by creating a personal portfolio project and establishing a consistent blogging routine to showcase my skills and knowledge. Additionally, I plan to develop a comprehensive ecommerce project using NopCommerce, learn about RESTful APIs and microservices architecture, and build a Command-Line Interface (CLI) application using Java. I also intend to explore web scraping using Python and automate tasks using Azure DevOps, Key Vault, and Logic Apps. By achieving these goals, I aim to enhance my technical skills, improve my online presence, and increase my employability in the tech industry.

## Weekly Status Updates 

- ### Areas of Growth: October 7, 2024 - October 13, 2024 

    - Community Involvement 

            - Working on workshop: memorizing and practicing key topics for Bubble sort, merge sort, and RSA. I am also memorizing and practicing key topics in top down programming and pair programming. 

            - Working on workshop: (1) add images to presentation, (2) add history slides for RSA top down programming and pair programming as needed (3) include time for group practice of top down programming and pair programming for bubble sort (practice this/ run through a few times) (4) create merge sort and RSA activities based on what they should know and have memorized for each in an interview (5) run through whole presetation a few times ideas of time frame and how users will set up the colleborative top down programming and pair programming part and the activities on their devices
